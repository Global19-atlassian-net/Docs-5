It is just the **CreateLayout** method of DroidScript with predefined values on background color just to be consistent on MUI theming.

It is highly recommended to use this method instead of directly calling **CreateLayout** from the app object.

### Card Layouts
Card layout is ligter than other types of layouts to make it appear as a primary focus on a page.

Since it returns a DroidScript layout object, you can use all the layout methods you know.
