The AdView is a control which makes it possible to earn money with your app.

<premium>
The AdView shows advertisement banners from the popular AdMob platform. (Further providers may be added in the future)

**NOTE:** Ads are not touchable when running in the DroidScript IDE.

To put ads in your app you must first [create an AdMob account](https://apps.admob.com/signup)
Then create the view and add it to your app as shown in the [Banner Ads sample]{OpenSample('Banner Ads')}

When finally publishing the app on GooglePlay remember to 'include ads' in the developer console.

<red>Warning: Don't repeatedly click on your own ads unless you are using a valid testId, or Google may suspend your Admob account!</red>
